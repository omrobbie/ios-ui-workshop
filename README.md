#  Session 1 - Basic in Texture

The session covers the basic of `Texture` that is the introduction of `ASDisplayNode` and how to use it along with `node container`.
Also we will learn how to build a simple layout with `layoutSpecBlock`

## Guide

This session is labeled under `Start` inside the `Session 1 - Basic ` folder in the `Xcode` project example. We will code together on the subsection `Rendering Component in Texture Way`.

#### Rendering Component in `UIKit` Way

Before we learn the basics of `Texture`, it is better we take a look at how `UIKit` structuring the views to rendering component on screen first.
1. Run the project
2. Tap on `Basic UIKit`.

On the screen, you can see a colored box centering on the page. Open the `BasicUIKitViewController.swift` to see the implementation. You may be familiar with the code, how to set up the `viewcontroller`, the child view, and the constraints. We will create something similar to that by using `Texture`, so let's get started!


#### Rendering Component in `Texture` Way

#### A. Open `BasicTextureViewController.swift`
The file will look like this:

```swift
import UIKit

class BasicTextureViewController: UIViewController {

}
```
The `BasicTextureViewController` still inherit the `UIViewController` so we need to change the subclass


#### B. Change the subclass of `ViewController` into `ASDKViewController`

Before we change the subclass, we need to import the framework `Texture` by adding `import AsyncDisplayKit`.  Next we change the subclass `viewController` into `ASDKViewController<ASDisplayNode>`. Why we do have a generic on our `ViewController`?. This generic used to determined which type of `root node` we want to use. In this case we just need a plain `ASDisplayNode` as our root `node`.

```swift
import AsyncDisplayKit
import UIKit

class BasicTextureViewController: ASDKViewController<ASDisplayNode> {

}
```
Note: In the Create `Product Card List Session` we will configure the `root node` with a different type of `ASDisplayNode`

#### C. Add initializer to the `ViewController`
Next, we need to create an initializer for our `viewController`. We can start by adding an empty `init()` but we need to add the `override` keyword before the init. The compiler will throw an error that we need to satisfy by adding `required init?(coder: NSCoder)`

```swift
......

class BasicTextureViewController: ASDKViewController<ASDisplayNode> {
    override init() {
        super.init()
    }

    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }
}
```

#### C. Create a root `Node` for `ViewController`

We have successfully changed our `ViewController` to `ASDKViewController` but the `viewController` shows a blank view with a black color background. That means our `root node`  has still not been configured yet, let's start by changing the init into `super.init(node: ASDisplayNode)`.

The parameter `node` means that we can use any kind of `ASDisplayNode` as our root `node` but let's stick with a simple `ASDisplayNode` for now.

We can change the background color or any property of the root `node` by accessing the `node.` property in our `ViewController`. It similar to when we are accessing the `view.` property in `UIViewController`.
Let's change the background color to `white` color

```swift
......
class BasicTextureViewController: ASDKViewController<ASDisplayNode> {
    override init() {
        super.init(node: ASDisplayNode())
        node.backgroundColor = .white
    }
    ......
}
```

#### D. Add the rectangle box
Now the fun part begins, we will create a rectangle box as the child of  `ViewController`. Create the box by initialize `ASDisplayNode()`.To make the box see clearly on the screen we can add some color and set the size of the box.

For the size, we can use `frame` property for now and let's start by adding a simple size by adding `subNode.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300)`.

After that, add your box into your `viewController` by using `node.addSubNode(subNode)`, It similar to `UIKit` `view.addSubview.`

```swift
......
class BasicTextureViewController: ASDKViewController<ASDisplayNode> {
    override init() {
        super.init(node: ASDisplayNode())
        node.backgroundColor = .white

        let subNode = ASDisplayNode()
        subNode.backgroundColor = .orange
        subNode.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300)

        node.addSubnode(subNode)
    }
    ......
}
```

#### E. Configure Layout by using `LayoutSpecBlock`

The box is showing up, but what are the advantages of layouting in `Texture`? it looks similar to `UIKit`.

Introduction: `LayoutSpecBlock`
`LayoutSpecBlock` is a closure where you play around with the layout. This is where the `Flexbox` concept is applied. The `LayoutSpecBlock` has 2 parameters:
- `node`: the `node` itself
- `constrainedSize`: the size of the root `node`

We don't need those 2 parameters for now so just omit them using `_, _`. The block needs a return type of `ASLayoutSpec` which is the kind of layout we want to use. There are many types of layout that we will learn in this workshop but for now, we will use `ASCenterLayout` to center the node.

```swift
......
class BasicTextureViewController: ASDKViewController<ASDisplayNode> {
    override init() {
        super.init(node: ASDisplayNode())
        node.backgroundColor = .white

        let subNode = ASDisplayNode()
        subNode.backgroundColor = .orange
        subNode.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300)

        node.addSubnode(subNode)
        node.layoutSpecBlock = { _, _ in
            return ASCenterLayoutSpec(centeringOptions: .XY,
                                      sizingOptions: [],
                                      child: subNode)
        }
    }
    ......
}
```

The `ASCenterLayout` has 3 parameters:
- `centeringOptions`: the position of the child, We use the `.XY`  value that means we will center the child on `Horizontal` and `Vertical` position.
- `sizingOptions`: how much space the center spec will take up. We don't need this configuration right now instead we can use an empty value `[]`.
- `child`: the node that will be centered, in this case, is `subNode` object.

The result is not the same as we not expected, the child node covers the whole screen, to fix that we can go to the next step.


#### F. Adjust box size by using `style.preferredSize`

Why did the `child node` cover the whole screen? the answer is we haven't set the size yet. We already set the size before on `.frame` but because right now we are using `layoutSpecBlock` the `frame` value is no longer valid. The goal of `layoutSpecBlock` is to apply the `FlexBox` concept which means we don't need to calculate the position & size manually. So let's fix the size.
By adding the `style.preferredSize`, we specified a constant size to our `child node`.

```swift
......
class BasicTextureViewController: ASDKViewController<ASDisplayNode> {
    override init() {
        super.init(node: ASDisplayNode())
        node.backgroundColor = .white

        let subNode = ASDisplayNode()
        subNode.backgroundColor = .orange
        // Change this
        // subNode.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300)
        // Into this
        subNode.style.preferredSize = CGSize(width: 300, height: 300)

        node.addSubnode(subNode)
        node.layoutSpecBlock = { _, _ in
            return ASCenterLayoutSpec(centeringOptions: .XY,
                                      sizingOptions: [],
                                      child: subNode)
        }
    }
   ......
}

```

Cool! Finally, we have successfully created a simple component using `Texture` by creating a node, plug it into `viewController`, and configure the layout using `layoutSpecBlock`. In the next session, we will explore various `LayoutSpecs`!


#  Session 2 - Layouting with LayoutSpec in Texture

This session covers the various types of `LayoutSpec` that we can use to configure the layouting of elements in our `ViewController` as well as creating a custom/reusable node of `ASDisplayNode` type.


## Guide

This session is labelled under `ASLayoutSpec - Interactive` in the XCode project example.
The files used in this session is under `Session 2 - InteractiveUI`.

#### LayoutSpec

- For each `LayoutSpec` (e.g.: `ASInsetLayoutSpec`), there will be a folder containing 2 files.
- `FooLayoutVC` contains the real implementation of the `LayoutSpec`
- `FooLayoutVCInteractive` contains a bordered sandbox which displays the view of `FooLayoutVC` scaled to the size of the sandbox
- `FooLayoutVCInteractive` also contains a set of labelled buttons for the audience to configure the arguments used in the relative `LayoutSpec`

#### Layout Breakdown

We have created 2 `ViewControllers` that implement a layout that uses a combination of different `LayoutSpecs`.
In this session, we hope to provide the audience with layout examples that may relate more to real-life cases when developing an app, which may help the audience understand more about the behaviours of various `LayoutSpecs` and how to achieve a specific layout by combining them.

#### Exercise

The goal of the exercises in this session is for the audience to re-create the layout provided in the example (`top-right button in navigation bar of every Exercise page`), all the elements (`nodes`) are provided

- Exercise 1 - Learn how to create the layout using a combination of `ASStackLayoutSpec` and `ASInsetLayoutSpec`
- Exercise 2 - Edit the layout from `Exercise 1` by adding `ASBackgroundLayoutSpec` to the layout
- Exercise 3 - Learn how to create a reusable custom node of `ASDisplayNode` type and achieve the same result as `Exercise 2`, but only instantiating `CustomNode` instead of a bunch of elements in the `ViewController`

#### Notes

- Cheats for `Exercise 1`, `Exercise 2`, and `Exercise 3` are provided under `Session 2 - InteractiveUI/Components/Cheats`
- It is recommended that the audience do not look at the cheats until the exercises are complete or they are completely stuck


# Session 3 - Create a List of Product Cards

This session breaks down the process of creating a component using `Texture`.

## Product Card

`Product Card` is one of the most used components in `Tokopedia App`. It is used to represent the description of a product. However, every product has different amount of information. Thus, the presentation of each `Product Card` may vary.

## Expectation

After this session, you are expected to learn three things using `Texture`:


#### A. How to create a dynamic component

As stated earlier, not every `Product Card` displays the same amount of information. This session shows how to create a `Product Card` based on the information provided.

#### B. How to show a list of components

This session shows how to display a collection of products using `List` format.

#### C. How to perform a live update on a component

This session shows how easy it is to update the UI of a `Texture` component.

## Creating a Product Card

This session is covered in the folder labelled as `Session 3 - Create Product Card`

Before we start, to have a better picture on what we are going to create, do the followings.
1. Run the project
2. Tap on `Create Product Card`.
3. Then, tap on `Expected`

Also, take a look at the information model.
1. Go back to Xcode
2. Open `Product.swift`

Now, let's start!

#### A. Open `Start/ProductCardNode.swift`

This is the main class of the Product Card component.

#### B. Start Small

Let's put product image, name and price first.

1. Add the nodes as properties
    ```swift
    let imageNode = ASNetworkImageNode()
    let nameNode = ASTextNode()
    let priceNode = ASTextNode()
    ```

2. Setup the nodes
    ```swift
    imageNode.url = model.imageUrl
    imageNode.style.preferredSize = CGSize(width: 80, height: 80)

    nameNode.attributedText = NSAttributedString(
        string: description.name,
        attributes: [
            NSAttributedString.Key.font : UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12, weight: .regular)
        ]
    )

    priceNode.attributedText = NSAttributedString(
        string: description.price,
        attributes: [
            .font: UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 14, weight: .bold)
        ]
    )
    ```

3. Arrange it in `LayoutSpecThatFits`
    ```swift
    let verticalStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .vertical,
        spacing: 10,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            nameNode,
            priceNode
        ]
    )

    let mainStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 8,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            imageNode,
            verticalStack
        ]
    )

    let mainInset = ASInsetLayoutSpec(
        insets: UIEdgeInsets(top: 8, left: 8, bottom: 8, right: 8),
        child: mainStack
    )

    return mainInset
    ```

4. Run the project and see the result

#### C. Create Shop Row

Before we continue, it is better to refactor the right hand side of the `Product Card` into a new class. Else, we might have a bloated code like this.

```swift
override func layoutSpecThatFits(_ constrainedSize: ASSizeRange) -> ASLayoutSpec {
    let shopStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 4,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            badgeNode,
            nameNode
        ]
    )

    let verticalStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .vertical,
        spacing: 10,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            nameNode,
            priceNode,
            shopNode
        ]
    )

    let mainStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 8,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            imageNode,
            verticalStack
        ]
    )

    let mainInset = ASInsetLayoutSpec(
        insets: UIEdgeInsets(top: 8, left: 8, bottom: 8, right: 8),
        child: mainStack
    )

    return mainInset
}
```

So, let's move the vertical stack

1. Cut this
    ```swift
    let nameNode = ASTextNode()
    let priceNode = ASTextNode()
    ```

2. This
    ```swift
    nameNode.attributedText = NSAttributedString(
        string: description.name,
        attributes: [
            NSAttributedString.Key.font : UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12, weight: .regular)
        ]
    )

    priceNode.attributedText = NSAttributedString(
        string: description.price,
        attributes: [
            .font: UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 14, weight: .bold)
        ]
    )
    ```

3. And This
    ```swift
    let verticalStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .vertical,
        spacing: 10,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            nameNode,
            priceNode
        ]
    )
    ```

4. Then paste it to `Start/Components/ProductCardDescriptionNode.swift`

5. Add this node into `Start/ProductCardNode.swift`
    ```swift
    let descriptionNode: ProductCardDescriptionNode
    ```
    ```swift
    descriptionNode = ProductCardDescriptionNode(description: model.description)
    ```
    ```swift
    let mainStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 8,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            imageNode,
            descriptionNode
        ]
    )
    ```

> Phew, now that we got that out of the way, let's... WAIT! One more thing. This shop row is a bit different from name row and price row, because the badge may or may not be displayed based on the shop type.

> Please take a look at `Start/CreateProductCardViewController.swift`. That is the data that we will feed into the product card. Let's change the shop type from `.officialStore` to `.none`. After that, run the project again and take a look at the expected `Product Card`. Something is missing...

Okay now, let's continue :).

1. Open `Start/Components/ProductCardShopNode`
    We will create the shop row here

2. Add the nodes as properties
    ```swift
    let badgeNode: ASImageNode?
    let nameNode = ASTextNode()
    ```
    You might notice the optional, what is that for? Well, remember that the badge can disappear?

3. Setup the nodes
    ```swift
    switch shop.type {
        case .officialStore:
            badgeNode = ASImageNode()
            badgeNode.image = UIImage(named: "official_store")
        case .powerMerchant:
            badgeNode = ASImageNode()
            badgeNode.image = UIImage(named: "power_merchant")
        case .none:
            badgeNode = nil
    }

    badgeNode?.style.preferredSize = CGSize(width: 16, height: 16)

    nameNode.attributedText = NSAttributedString(
        string: shop.name,
        attributes: [
            .font: UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12, weight: .regular),
            .foregroundColor: UIColor.darkGray
        ]
    )
    ```

4. Arrange it in `LayoutSpecThatFits`
    ```swift
    return ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 4,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [badgeNode, nameNode]
    )
    ```

    Oh no, there is an error! The reason is that `children` expects `[ASLayoutElement]` not `[ASLayoutElement?]`. What do we do? We may define a `children` property before adding it into the stack.
    ```swift
    let children: [ASLayoutElement]
    if let badgeNode = badgeNode { // safe unwrap
        children = [badgeNode, nameNode]
    } else {
        children = [nameNode]
    }

    return ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 4,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: children
    )
    ```

    Or we can take advantage of Swift's High Order Function `compactMap`.
    ```swift
    return ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 4,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [badgeNode, nameNode].compactMap { $0 }
    )
    ```

    Basically, `compactMap` filters all nil values out of a collection.

5. Add this node into `Start/Components/ProductCardDescriptionNode.swift`
    ```swift
    let shopNode: ProductCardShopNode
    ```
    ```swift
    shopNode = ProductCardShopNode(shop: description.shop)
    ```
    ```swift
    return ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .vertical,
        spacing: 10,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            nameNode,
            priceNode,
            shopNode
        ]
    )
    ```

6. Run the project and see the result

#### D. Create Review Row

One thing you might notice about this row is that the stars are stacked horizontally, and then the star stack is stacked again with review count text. This time, there is no need to move the star stack into a new class because the layout is relatively simple.

1. Open `Start/Components/ProductCardReviewNode.swift`
    We will create the review row here

2. Add the nodes as properties
    ```swift
    let starNodes: [ASImageNode]
    let reviewCountNode = ASTextNode()
    ```

3. Setup the nodes
    ```swift
    var tempStarNodes = [ASImageNode]()

    for index in 1...5 {
        let starNode = ASImageNode()
        starNode.image = UIImage(named: index >= review.rating ? "active_star" : "inactive_star")
        starNode.style.preferredSize = CGSize(width: 11, height: 11)
        tempStarNodes.append(starNode)
    }

    starNodes = tempStarNodes

    reviewCountNode.attributedText = NSAttributedString(
        string: "(\(review.reviewCount))",
        attributes: [
            .font: UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12, weight: .regular),
            .foregroundColor: UIColor.gray
        ]
    )
    ```

4. Arrange it in `LayoutSpecThatFits`
    ```swift
    let starStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 1,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: starNodes
    )

    let mainStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 2,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .center,
        children: [starStack, reviewCountNode]
    )

    return mainStack
    ```

5. Add this node into `Start/Components/ProductCardDescriptionNode.swift`
    ```swift
    let reviewNode: ProductCardReviewNode
    ```
    ```swift
    reviewNode = ProductCardReviewNode(review: description.review)
    ```
    ```swift
    return ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .vertical,
        spacing: 10,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            nameNode,
            priceNode,
            shopNode,
            reviewNode
        ]
    )
    ```

6. Run the project and see the result

#### E. Create Free Shipping Row

This row is optional, as free shipping badge may only be shown if `isFreeShipping == true` (refer to `Start/CreateProductCardViewController.swift`). Also, this row only contains one image node so there is no need to create a new node class.

1. Add this node into `Start/ProductCardDescriptionNode.swift`
    ```swift
    let freeShippingNode: ASImageNode?
    ```
    ```swift
    freeShippingNode = description.isFreeShipping? ASImageNode() : nil
    freeShippingNode?.image = UIImage(named: "free_shipping")
    freeShippingNode?.style.preferredSize = CGSize(width: 67, height: 16)
    ```
    ```swift
    return ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .vertical,
        spacing: 10,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            nameNode,
            priceNode,
            shopNode,
            reviewNode,
            freeShippingNode
        ].compactMap { $0 }
    )
    ```

2. Run the project and see the result

3. What if we want to add more spacing between reviewNode and freeShippingNode?
    ```swift
    freeShippingNode?.style.spacingBefore = 4 // there is also spacing after if you need it
    ```

#### F. Add Wishlist

in this part, we will refactor the ImageNode to Class `ProductCardImageNode`, and we will attach a wishlist in the top corner(inside) of the image

1. Open `ProductCardNode`.

2. Move `imageNode` into `ProductCardImageNode`.
 ```swift
  let imageNode: ASNetworkImageNode
  // in init
  imageNode = ASNetworkImageNode()
  imageNode.url = imageUrl
  imageNode.style.preferredSize = CGSize(width: 80, height: 80)
  imageNode.cornerRadius = 6
  ```

3. Add `ProductCardWishlistNode`
    ```swift
    let wishlistNode = ProductCardWishlistNode()
    ```

4. Create layout for `ProductCardImageNode`
 ```swift
 let wishlistInset = ASInsetLayoutSpec(
   insets: UIEdgeInsets(top: 4, left: 4, bottom: .infinity, right: .infinity),
   child: wishlistNode
 )

 return ASOverlayLayoutSpec(child: imageNode, overlay: wishlistInset)
  ```

5. Add `ProductCardImageNode` into `ProductCardNode`
    ```swift
    let imageNode: ProductCardImageNode
    ```
    ```swift
    imageNode = ProductCardImageNode(imageUrl: model.imageUrl)
    ```
    ```swift
    let mainStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
        direction: .horizontal,
        spacing: 8,
        justifyContent: .start,
        alignItems: .start,
        children: [
            imageNode,
            descriptionNode
        ]
    )
    ```

6. Run the project and see the result


#### G. Summary

Well, there you go. Easy, isn't it? In a nutshell, there are three steps to create a component using `Texture`:
1. Create properties of all nodes
2. Setup the nodes
3. Arrange it in `LayoutSpecThatFits.`

Now let's move on to the next step: `Creating a List of Product Card.`

#### H. Move ProductCard to Lists
In this part, we will show how to create lists using a Table node with auto height.

Next, we will create a `List of Product Card` using `TableNode.`

1. Change `ProductCardNode` subclass to `ASCellNode`
2. Open `ProductCardStarterViewController`
3. Change the `ASDKViewController<ASDisplayNode>` generic to `ASDKViewController<ASTableNode>` and `super.init` to confirm with `ASTableNode`
3. For use `TableNode` we need `data source` to give information what data we will render
 ```swift
  node.dataSource = self
  ```
 then we need to implement two method `numberOfRowsInSection` this method
 give the detail to how many data we will render and `nodeForRowAt` to give
 the information which cell will render
 ```
  extension ProductCardViewController: ASTableDataSource {
   func tableNode(_ tableNode: ASTableNode, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
    return model.count
   }

   func tableNode(_ tableNode: ASTableNode, nodeForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> ASCellNode {
    let data = model[indexPath.row]
    return ProductCardFinalNode(model: data)
   }
  }
  ```
4. Build and run the app now our `ProductCardList` seems good with different detail of height
 but we still find a separtor now we will delete it to delete it we need implement method
 `viewDidLoad` because we will acess the `tableNode.view`
 ```swift
  override func viewDidLoad() {
   super.viewDidLoad()
   node.view.separatorStyle = .none
  }
  ```

#### I. Create Live Update on Component

In this part, we will perform a live update component on wishlist refer to product card expected wishlist could toggle on and off.

1. Open `start/ProductCardWishlistNode`.
2. Add action to activeNode and inactiveNode.
 ```swift
  activeNode.addTarget(self, action: #selector(changeWishlistState), forControlEvents: .touchUpInside)
  inactiveNode.addTarget(self, action: #selector(changeWishlistState), forControlEvents: .touchUpInside)
  ```
3. Move to line create a new property to handle state wishlist.
 ```swift
  var isWishlist = false
  ```
4. Move to function `changeWishlistState` add toogle on and toogle off for wishlist
 ```swift
  @objc func changeWishlistState() {
   // change the state vice versa
   isWishlist = !isWishlist
   setNeedsLayout()
  }
  ```
 by calling `setNeedsLayout()` we trigger the `layoutSpecThatFits` to layout again.
5. Move to `layoutSpecThatFits` this function will return an active node because we want to toggle on/off the wishlist so that we will add.
 ```swift
  var child: ASImageNode

  if isWishlist {
   child = activeNode
  } else {
   child = inactiveNode
  }

  let wishlistInset = ASInsetLayoutSpec(
   insets: UIEdgeInsets(top: 2, left: 2, bottom: 2, right: 2),
   child: child
  )
  ```
6. Build and run

In this part, you can see that our `lists of product cards` are working fine. You can `toggle the wishlist,` but we have an inset issue from our product cards, so the challenge is to fixing the card inset.
- Clue: background and insets
- Cheat: you can checkout branch `BeautyProductCard`.


#  Session 4 - Usage Comparison with UIKit

In this session, we will compare with the usage of UIKit for the same UI component, which is `Wish List Product Card`, from the implementation and performance perspective.


## Code Implementation

In UIKit, we usually use `Auto Layout` and managing `Constraints` to dynamically calculate the size and position of all the views. Sometimes it can be cumbersome to manage the `Constraints` if we had a lot of UI components, and these components need to be optionally placed on the view hierarchy. In this example, we use `Constraints` to manage UI components' size and position.


#### 1. Open folder group named `Session 4 - UIKit Way`

We already created an example of UIKit implementation for `Wish List Product Card`. The view itself located in the `InterfaceBuilder` folder group, and we use `XIB` to construct it. Also, we had created a separated sub-component for the `Rating View` in the `Components` folder group to make it easy to manage.


#### 2. Look into ProductCardWishlistTableViewCell.xib implementation

Next, open the `ProductCardWishlistTableViewCell.xib` file. We declared this UI component as `UITableViewCell` because we want to put it on `UITableView`. If you dig deeper into the child-views, you can see these components heavily-dependent on `Constraints` to manage its size and position.

With implementation like this, how to hide the `view components` that not need to be shown in a certain condition? To achieve that, usually, we can manage `Constraints` by:

- Managing it's `constant` property
- Managing it's `isActive` state


#### 3. Open ProductCardWishlistTableViewCell.swift implementation

In this file, we already implement the code for us. We see that we have `Constraint Outlets` section. We will heavily depend on that.


#### 4. Managing Shop Badge Image

In the current implementation, to change the `Shop Badge` image, we can change the `shopBadgeImage.image` property to the preferred image. But for managing the hidden state, we still only change the `shopBadgeImage.isHidden` property. If you run this code, this implementation only hiding the view itself and leaving blank space on it.

![Shop Badge Issue](https://i.postimg.cc/j26zvXyF/shop-badge.png)

But, if we want to hide the view and also remove the blank space, how to do that?

In the `refreshUi()` method, you can see the switch case section for `shop type`. In each case, you can try to enable: `showShopBadge(with:)` or `hideShopBadge()` code and make the rest disabled by commenting them out. After that, let's try to run it.

![Shop Badge Issue Fixed](https://i.postimg.cc/sDyPxkrd/shop-badge-fixed.png)

You can see, the new implementation can make the `Shop Badge` image hidden and eliminate the blank space. If you see the `showShopBadge(with:)` and `hideShopBadge()` code, we managing `constant` property of `shopBadgeWidthConstraint` and `shopBadgeGap` Constraints to hide the blank space.

By this implementation, the sizing can be wrong, which can be caused by human error if we need to change the view size in the `XIB` but we forget to change in the `.swift` too. This error can be minimized if we implementing full UI implementation programmatically without using `XIB`.


#### 5. Managing Rating and "Bebas Ongkir" View State

If we see the `Managing Shop Badge Image` implementation, the implementation looks simple. But it can be otherwise if we need to handle multiple `Views'` state.

We have already run the previous implementation. If we look at the screen, we can see there's blank space too while hiding the `Rating` and `Bebas Ongkir` view.

![Rating and Free Shipping Issue](https://i.postimg.cc/ry5C887N/rating-freeshipping.png)

To fix that we can see in the `ProductCardWishlistTableViewCell.swift` file, on the `refreshUI()` method, there's a section called `#2 Extra Cases: Hiding both rating bar and free shipping`.

Below that section, we need to disable the codes that have commented on it by comment it out. Also, we need to enable other codes below of previous code, which has commented on it too, by uncommenting it. Try to run the code.

![Rating and Free Shipping Issue](https://i.postimg.cc/650rvMW7/rating-freeshipping-fixed.png)

As we can see, now the UI can be shown properly by removing blanks space if the `Rating` and/or `Free Shipping` image was hidden. If you see the codes that you enable by uncommenting-out before, we heavily managing the `Constraints` state there. We need to turn-off the un-needed `Constraints` first and enable what we need. If you wrongly manage it, the `Constraints` can be broken and the UI can be glitched because the `OS` will attempt to fix that broken `Constraints` and sometimes it fixed in the wrong way.

Imagine if we had many `View components` that need to be dynamically shown based on a certain state.


#### 6. UIStackView

In some years ago, Apple introduced `UIStackView` that we can use to easily manage the `View components` state. If we hide a `view` in the stack, `UIStackView` will automatically manage for removing blank space of that `view`.

But in some conditions, it can be painful to control `UIStackView` if we had deep-nested `UIStackView` and some `child-view` have a different size than the other. Also for spacing between each element, it should be of the same size. For handling that, usually we need to use dummy `UIView` that acts as `spacer`.


## Performance

As we know, `Texture` has the benefit of its `UI Calculation` because it is done in the background thread, contrary to `UIKit` that the calculation is done in the main thread.

We already made a video showing the performance of both, that shown in `FPS` metrics. In that video, we showing the implementation of `iPhone 5` with `iOS 9`. In that video, it clearly shows that `UIKit` implementation have performance drop. It has an average of 30++ fps compared to `Texture` that has an average of 50++ fps.

###### UIKit Implementation

###### Texture Implementation
![Texture Implementation FPS Metrics](https://i.postimg.cc/7Lp0kcVR/texture-fps.png)

We can improve the `UIKit` implementation by implementing `shadowPath` for showing the shadow. Also, we already made a video showing the performance while using `shadowPath`. The `FPS` increased to average 40++ fps, but still can't on par with `Texture`.

# Session 5 - Future
So far we talk about past and present, and now this time we will talk about future.
We've talk about the advantages of using Texture, and what make we more confident to use Texture is by looking at some big companies like Pinterest and Telegram are using Texture in their iOS apps.

All of our workshop session show lot of benefit of using Texture, but if you check at the syntax of Texture, it still have lot of code and not "declarative" like SwiftUI. For SwiftUI, we can't used it yet on our main app because we still need to support iOS < 13, and SwiftUI is "a bit" buggy on iOS 13 as well. This is how our Texture layout code looks like:

```swift
let vStack = ASStackLayoutSpec(
	direction: .vertical,
	spacing: 16,
	justifyContent: .start,
	alignItems: .start,
	children: [tokopediaText, tokopediaButtonNode]
)

return ASStackLayoutSpec(
	direction: .horizontal,
	spacing: 16,
	justifyContent: .start,
	alignItems: .start,
	children: [vStack, goBtnNode]
)
```

Compare to SwiftUI code, the Texture code still look much more code than the SwiftUI one.
```swift
HStack {
	VStack {
		Text("Hello World")
		Button("Tokopedia") {}
	}
	Button("Go!") {}
}
```

That's where the `TextureSwiftSupport` shines. This library can made your Texture layouting code more like SwiftUI code by leveraging function builder swift feature that introduced in Swift version 5.1.
That texture code can be converted to SwiftUI like this:
```swift
LayoutSpec {
	HStackLayout(spacing: 16) {
		tokopediaText
		tokopediaButtonNode
	}
	goBtnNode
}
```

And by the way, if you follow the Tokopedia iOS hotest news in early October, we've launch our first Widget! Built exclusively using SwiftUI. and our devs said that learning Texture make it easier for them to learn SwiftUI!

![Tokopedia Widget](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/2305495/screenshots/14396292/media/7f520c20f6228b839a717edb008c4acd.jpg)

For final word, this is our quote of the day:
`One step closer to learn SwiftUI but with UIKit foundation in a simpler way`
